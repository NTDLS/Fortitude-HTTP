<h2>Global - Socket Pools</h2>
<hr/>

<blockquote>
Socket pools are designed to allow Fortitude HTTP to share a common port between multiple websites. They can also be
used to pool resources for a subset of websites and bind to specific IP addresses (or all IP addresses) and to balance
throughput capabilities and memory load. Every website requires a socket pool, without one - the website cannot be started.

			Sets the initial size of each connected peers send and receive buffers. If the remote

			Buffer Size. The same applies to receiving; when the server can't process received
			data quickly enough, the buffer resized to store received data up to the Max Buffer Size.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Max Buffer Size</td>
		<td>Defines the maximum size of the internal per-connection data-pump buffer size. The buffer size is automatically resized as needed, typically due to an inability of the file system or network layers to keep-up with demand. This setting can be used to limit the amount of memory which will be consumed for this purpose. Can be set to 0 to allow the buffer to grow restriction. See [Initial Buffer Size] for more information.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>File Buffer Size</td>
		<td>The file buffer size defines the number of bytes at a time which will be read at a time when handing file I/O operations (such as compression and reading from the disk for network transmission to a connected peer). Higher setting generally increase throughput but will demand more memory. See [Initial Buffer Size] for more information.</td>
