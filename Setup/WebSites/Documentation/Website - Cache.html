<h2>Website - Cache</h2>
<hr/>

<blockquote>
The website cache is used to store pre-compressed copies of static content. The cache is built as requests
are made for content. Compression configurations which are local to a single website will have their own
cache - but the global cache is shared amongst all websites.

<h3>Cache</h3>
Allows the server administrator to view the website cache, along with the names of the cached files, their compression ratios and hit counts.

The entry is however still kept in the cache so that the server does not repeatedly re-compress the requested file.</td>
