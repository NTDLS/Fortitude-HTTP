While development began in June of the year 2000, the server has endured four nearly entire rewrites in order to keep up with the changing land scape in modern internet architecture.
As of the latest release, the web-server is semi-full-featured, lacking only advanced features such as HTTP authentication, SAPI and SSL - each of which is in planned implementation.

<font size="3"><p>
It is also worth noting that Fortitude HTTP is fully open sourced and all of its components are freely available via NetworkDLS.com with complete source code
under an unencumbered LGPL v3 license, thus making Fortitude HTTP the ideal web server for bundled distribution with products which require a local web server.

You can even contribute by submitting your own patches to the SVN project or contacting us directly.
