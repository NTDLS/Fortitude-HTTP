<h2>Website - Scripting - CGI Folders</h2>
<hr/>

<blockquote>
The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard method for web server software to delegate the
generation of web content to executable files. Such files are known as CGI scripts; they are programs,
often stand-alone applications, usually written in a scripting language. These programs/scripts when
placed into a "CGI bin" directory are executed by default using the application associated with the
extension in the operating system - much like the programs were executed directly. The output which
is produced from this execution is piped to the connected peer - usually in the form of HTMl to a
browser but can also produce other consumable content such as images.
