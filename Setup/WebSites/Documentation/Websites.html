<blockquote>
Websites are the core of the webserver. Each website comes with a plethora of configurable attributes.
The websites node in the Fortitude HTTP management console is a good place to start to get an overview
of your websites and add/edit/delete them at will.

<h3>Websites - Item</h3>
This is the first step to adding a new website. You'll need to provide only basic information such as site name,
root and socket pool. Additional configuration is performed elsewhere in the website settings after creation.

		<td>Root</td>
		<td>Specifies where the website content resides on the file-system. This can be a local or UNC path.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Socket Pool</td>
		<td>Defines the socket pool which is how the website derives its port and IP address bindings. See also: <a href="/Global - Socket Pools.html">Socket Pools</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Host Names</td>
		<td>Optionally defines which host names the website will respond to. Each request made by modern web-browsers
		includes a “host header” which identifies which domain the user is requesting. In this way, multiple websites
		can share a single socket pool and therefor share a single IP address and listen port. See also: <a href="/Global - Socket Pools.html">Socket Pools</a>.</td>
