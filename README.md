Fortitude HTTP is a web server for Windows which was created to give users a free, easy-to-use and open-source alternative to commercial Windows web servers - though it's really more of an accademia thing in 2019.

Supports: Multiple sites, port sharing, virtual roots, CGI, scripting engines, custom filters, HTTP compression &amp; caching, HTTP 1.1 resume, an easy to use front end, a fully configurable XML back-end and much more.
